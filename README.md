### :woman_technologist: Introduction

In the current trends, the technologies have been advanced. Most of the
individuals prefer using the internet as the primary medium to transfer data from
one end to another across the internet. There are many possible ways to transmit
data using the internet like: via e-mails, sending text and images, etc. In the
present communication world, images are widely in use.
However, one of the main problems with sending data over the Internet is the
‘security’ and authenticity. Data security basically means the protection of data
from unauthorised users or attackers. As a result, different security techniques
have been used to provide the required protection. The security of digital
images has attracted more attention recently, and many different image
encryption methods have been proposed to enhance the security of these
images.
Encryption is one of the techniques for information security. Image encryption
is a technique that converts the original image to another form that is difficult to
understand. No one can access the content without knowing a decryption key.
On the other hand, image decryption retrieves the original image from the
encrypted one. Image encryption has various applications in the corporate
world, health care, military operations, and multimedia systems.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Problem Statement

The purpose of this project is to provide effective image data encryption with
the aim of resisting statistical attacks and data breaches. This will enable the
communicating parties to exchange sensitive data without leaking the data.
The underlying respective architecture of most IT systems, including the
desktop computer and internet, does not guarantee security. Users with
malicious intents have always found a way of exploiting one vulnerability or the
other. An attack that affects the confidentiality of information often presents the
platform for the integrity of such information to be compromised. Intercepted
information on transit would make little or no sense to an interceptor if he is not
able to decipher the content of the information. This explains why it is very
necessary to ensure that even when an intruder or unauthorised user
successfully obtains access to some information the confidentiality and integrity
of the information remain uncompromised.

### :zap: Motivation

As digital images play an important role in multimedia technology, it becomes
more important for the user’s to maintain privacy. And to provide such security
and privacy to the user, image encryption and decryption is very important to
protect from any unauthorised user access. Providing security to the users so
that no one can access the image which is in the open network. It is very
important to affirm the integrity and confidentiality of the digital image that is
being transmitted. Information has to be accessed only by the authorised party
and not by anyone else such that no one can access the content in between.

### :telescope: Objective

The model for encryption and decryption of an image is designed with the
following objectives:
● For transmission of the image based on data as well as storage it should
have confidentiality and security by using a suitable key.
● To study the architecture of the image file.
● The main objective of this image encryption method is to obtain a top
quality hidden image in order to keep information secret.
● Many factors have to be considered in order to develop the application
such as processing speed of image, the strength of encryption result and
ease of use to end users.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Methodology

- Get the image to be encrypted from the user by displaying a GUI for the
user to select an image from its system , Processing a deciphered image
for the receiver on key.
- Converting the image to a matrix with each value in it having RGBA
values of each pixel.
- Transforming this matrix to encrypt its values using any of the suitable
cipher techniques.
- Processing the new encrypted image through this matrix.
- For decrypting an image, We input the key from the receiver and generate
the original image only in case the key matches.

### :zap: Conclusion

The image encryption and decryption algorithm is designed and implemented to
provide confidentiality and security in transmission of the image.
